    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine asparagus, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and onion in a large saucepan; cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until asparagus is tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender; puree until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium; add remaining chicken broth, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils. Stir in pureed asparagus and milk.</li>
        <li>Place sour cream in a small bowl and stir in a ladleful of hot soup until blended; pour into the soup and stir in lemon juice. Warm soup through to serving temperature, without boiling. Serve immediately.</li>
